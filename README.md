# vawfuzzyindex
Stata dofile to replicate the fuzzy multidimensional index of violence against women proposed by Bettio, Ticci, and Betti (2020) (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-019-02197-7). This article formalizes an index of violence against women that accounts for prevalence, frequency and severity of each abuse. 
The code has been developed by Fernando Flores Tavares, Gianni Betti, Francesca Bettio, and Elisa Ticci following the structure of the FRA survey (https://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/survey-data-explorer-violence-against-women-survey#:~:text=The%20FRA%20survey%20on%20violence,on%20women's%20experiences%20of%20violence) but can be adapted to other surveys, provided they are representative of the population of reference.
